The library database is designed to manage a multi-branch library system efficiently. It consists of six tables: Branch, Employee, Books, Customer, IssueStatus, and ReturnStatus. The Branch table stores details of library branches, while the Employee table records staff information for each branch. The Books table tracks available books, and the Customer table keeps details of library members. Transactions such as book borrowing and returns are recorded in the IssueStatus and ReturnStatus tables. With these interconnected tables and 25 sample entries, the database ensures seamless management of inventory, employee roles, and customer activities across all branches.
